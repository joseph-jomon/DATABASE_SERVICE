Since the `validation_models.py` file is located in the same directory as `vdb_ingest.py` and you are still getting the `ModuleNotFoundError`, it may be due to one of the following reasons:

1. **Relative Imports**: Ensure you are using the correct import style. If you are running the script from a different directory (e.g., from a higher-level directory), Python might be treating them as packages and requiring relative imports. You can modify the import statement to use a relative import like this:

   ```python
   from .validation_models import VDBDocument, VDBSearchDocument, SearchResponse
   ```

   This assumes that the script is part of a package and that Python is treating the folder as a package/module.

2. **Running as a Module**: If the above approach doesn't work, try running the script as a module using the `-m` flag from the top-level directory. This way, Python handles the imports more cleanly:

   ```bash
   python -m vdb_app.vdb_main
   ```

   This ensures that Python understands the current package structure and resolves the import paths correctly.

3. **Incorrect Working Directory**: If you're running your script from a different directory (e.g., you are in a higher-level directory), Python may not recognize the module path correctly. Ensure that you are in the correct working directory where the `vdb_app` folder exists. You can print the working directory using:

   ```python
   import os
   print(os.getcwd())
   ```

   Then, ensure that the working directory matches where the `validation_models.py` file is located.

4. **Package Structure**: Ensure that your folder structure is recognized as a package by Python. This usually means ensuring thereâ€™s an `__init__.py` file in the directories, especially if you're working with nested folders. For example:

   ```
   vdb_app/
       __init__.py
       vdb_main.py
       routers/
           __init__.py
           vdb_ingest.py
       validation_models.py
   ```

If none of these solve the issue, please verify the full path from where you're running the script and check if any other conditions (like environment variables or symlinks) might be affecting module resolution.
