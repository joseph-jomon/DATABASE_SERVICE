When deciding on a professional and standard approach for managing dependencies, the key considerations are maintainability, clarity, and how well the approach scales with the complexity of your application. Here’s a breakdown of the options and the most professional approach:

### Option 1: Using a Function-Based Dependency
- **Simplicity**: Functions are easy to understand and use, making them a good choice for simpler dependencies.
- **Scalability**: Function-based dependencies can become cumbersome as the number of dependencies grows or when you need to pass multiple parameters.

### Option 2: Using a Class-Based Dependency
- **Encapsulation**: Classes are better at encapsulating behavior and state, which can be useful when the dependency has more complex initialization logic or needs to manage state across multiple methods.
- **Reusability**: A class-based approach can make it easier to reuse logic across different parts of your application.
- **Clarity**: Classes can make your code more modular and easier to understand, especially in larger projects.

### Professional and Standard Approach

Given these considerations, **using a class-based dependency** is often the more professional and standard approach, especially for more complex scenarios. It provides better encapsulation, modularity, and reusability.

Here’s how you can implement it:

#### 1. Define the `SMTPClient` Class

```python
# email_client.py

class SMTPClient:
    def __init__(self, smtp_server: str, port: int):
        self.smtp_server = smtp_server
        self.port = port

    def send_email(self, recipient: str, content: str):
        print(f"Sending email to {recipient} via {self.smtp_server}:{self.port}")
```

#### 2. Implement a Class-Based Dependency

Create a dependency class that encapsulates the logic for initializing and using `SMTPClient`. This class will pull values from `app.state` and can also take in parameters from the route.

```python
from fastapi import Request

class SMTPClientDependency:
    def __init__(self, request: Request):
        # Access the SMTP server and port from app.state
        smtp_server = request.app.state.smtp_server
        smtp_port = request.app.state.smtp_port

        # Initialize the SMTPClient with these values
        self.smtp_client = SMTPClient(smtp_server=smtp_server, port=smtp_port)

    def send_email(self, recipient: str, content: str):
        self.smtp_client.send_email(recipient=recipient, content=content)
```

#### 3. Use the Dependency Class in FastAPI Routes

You can then inject this class as a dependency in your route handlers:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/send-email/")
async def send_email(
    recipient: str,
    content: str,
    smtp_client_dependency: SMTPClientDependency = Depends()
):
    smtp_client_dependency.send_email(recipient=recipient, content=content)
    return {"status": "Email sent"}
```

#### 4. Initialize Application State in the Lifespan Event

Make sure to initialize the required values in `app.state` during the application’s startup:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    # Initialize the SMTP server and port in app.state
    app.state.smtp_server = "smtp.example.com"
    app.state.smtp_port = 587
    yield
    # Perform any cleanup if necessary

app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)
```

### Why This Approach?

- **Encapsulation**: The `SMTPClientDependency` class encapsulates the logic for managing the SMTP client, keeping your route handlers clean and focused on business logic.
- **Modularity**: This approach makes your code more modular, as the SMTP logic is encapsulated in its own class.
- **Testability**: It’s easier to mock classes in unit tests, especially when you need to test routes that depend on complex dependencies like an SMTP client.
- **Scalability**: As your application grows, this approach scales well, allowing you to manage complex dependencies more easily.

### Conclusion

Using a class-based dependency is generally more professional and scalable for managing complex dependencies in FastAPI. This approach provides better encapsulation, clarity, and testability, making it ideal for larger or more complex applications. By leveraging FastAPI’s dependency injection system with class-based dependencies, you ensure that your application remains maintainable and modular as it grows.
