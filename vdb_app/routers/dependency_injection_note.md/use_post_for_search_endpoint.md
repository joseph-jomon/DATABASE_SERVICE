The error you encountered—**"Request with GET/HEAD method cannot have body"**—is related to how HTTP GET requests work. In the HTTP specification, **GET** requests are meant to retrieve data without modifying the server's state, and they traditionally do **not** include a request body (only parameters in the URL).

However, in your `search` endpoint, you're building a **query** that is being passed to a search function. If you're attempting to send this query in the request body, this would cause issues, especially if the request is being made using the GET method.

### Why It Happens:
- **GET requests**: These are designed to only include data in the **URL parameters** (query string). If you attempt to send a body with a GET request, the browser will throw an error, as per the HTTP standard.
- **Successful Response**: You may still get a successful response because FastAPI likely processed the request without checking the body for GET, but the client (browser) rejected it since the HTTP method does not allow bodies for GET requests.

### Solutions:

1. **Switch to a POST request**:
   If your query contains a complex JSON body (like your vector search), it is better to use a **POST** request instead of GET. POST requests allow sending a request body, which is well-suited for search queries like yours.

   Here's how you can change your `search` endpoint to use POST:

   ```python
   from fastapi import HTTPException, APIRouter, Depends

   @router.post("/search/{index_name}")  # Use POST instead of GET
   async def search(
       index_name: str,
       query_vector: list[float],
       doc_manager: Annotated[VDBDocumentManager, Depends(get_vdb_document_manager)]
   ):
       query = {
           "knn": {
               "field": "EMBEDDINGS_TEXT",
               "query_vector": query_vector,
               "k": 10,
               "num_candidates": 100,
           },
           "fields": ["Image", "Combined_Text", "Immobilie", "Headline", "Lage"],
       }

       try:
           response = await doc_manager.search_documents(query=query)
           return {"hits": response['hits']['hits']}
       except Exception as e:
           raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Search failed: {str(e)}")
   ```

   This will allow you to send the `query_vector` as part of the request body, and the POST method allows you to pass the full query without violating HTTP standards.

2. **Use URL parameters with GET**:
   If for some reason you need to stick with GET, you would need to pass all the data (including the query vector) as URL parameters, which can be cumbersome with large or complex data like dense vectors. Here’s an example of how you would construct the GET request:

   ```
   GET /search/{index_name}?query_vector=0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,....etc
   ```

   And then, you'd need to parse this vector from the URL parameters. But given the complexity of embedding vectors, **POST is the more appropriate method**.

### Why POST is Better for Search Queries:
- **GET** is meant for fetching data without modifying server state, but it has limitations with how much data you can pass in the URL.
- **POST** allows sending a complex body (like your dense vector search query) without the limitations of URL size and complexity.

### Conclusion:
- **Switch to POST** for your search operation, as it allows sending the query vector in the body and aligns better with how modern APIs handle complex search queries.
