In your Docker Compose file, the network `vdb_network` indeed enables communication between services, specifically `elasticsearch` and `databaseservice`, by allowing them to resolve each other by their container names.

For Docker containers to communicate on the same network, they can reference each other by their service names. In your case, `elasticsearch` is the service name, and since both `elasticsearch` and `databaseservice` are part of the `vdb_network`, you can access Elasticsearch from the `databaseservice` container using the hostname `elasticsearch`, which corresponds to the container's name.

Thus, the correct URL for Elasticsearch in the `databaseservice` environment should be:

```
http://elasticsearch:9200
```

### Explanation:
1. **`elasticsearch` as the hostname**: Since both services are on the same Docker network (`vdb_network`), Docker automatically sets up internal DNS for service-to-service communication. The service name `elasticsearch` resolves to the Elasticsearch container's IP address within this network.
2. **`vdb_network` is not the hostname**: `vdb_network` is the name of the Docker network, but it's not a hostname you would use for service communication. Docker assigns container names (like `elasticsearch`) as DNS entries inside the network.
3. **Port 9200**: This is the port exposed by the Elasticsearch service inside the Docker network and externally mapped to the host system. Inside the network, other containers only need to use the internal port `9200` on the service hostname.

Thus, `http://elasticsearch:9200` is correct because it allows the `databaseservice` to communicate directly with Elasticsearch over the Docker network.
