You do not need to manually create the `es_data` folder in your working directory. Docker will automatically create and manage this volume for you. Here’s how it works and the details regarding permissions:

### Understanding Docker Volumes

- **Named Volumes**: In the `docker-compose.yml` file, the `es_data` volume is a named volume. Named volumes are created and managed by Docker, and they are not tied to any specific directory on your host machine. Docker stores these volumes in a special directory on your machine, typically under `/var/lib/docker/volumes/` on Linux or within Docker's managed space on other operating systems.
  
- **No Manual Folder Creation**: You don’t need to create a folder named `es_data` anywhere in your project. Docker handles the creation and management of this volume.

- **Permissions**: Docker manages the permissions for the volume when it creates it. The Elasticsearch container will be able to read from and write to this volume without needing any additional configuration from you. However, if you ever need to interact with the volume directly (e.g., to inspect the files or manage the data manually), you might need appropriate permissions on your host machine, especially if you’re using a Linux-based OS.

### Practical Steps

1. **Running `docker-compose up`**:
   - When you run `docker-compose up`, Docker will automatically create the `es_data` volume.
   - Elasticsearch will store its data in this volume, specifically in the directory `/usr/share/elasticsearch/data` within the Elasticsearch container.

2. **Volume Location and Permissions**:
   - The `es_data` volume’s data is managed by Docker. If you need to access the files directly on the host machine (outside of Docker), you can find them in Docker's managed volumes directory (e.g., `/var/lib/docker/volumes/es_data/_data` on Linux).
   - Normally, you don’t need to worry about permissions, as Docker will handle them. If you do access the volume manually, you might need `sudo` privileges to read or modify files in Docker’s volume directory, depending on your system's configuration.

3. **Inspecting or Accessing the Volume**:
   - If you ever need to inspect what’s inside the `es_data` volume, you can do so using Docker commands. For example:
     ```bash
     docker volume inspect es_data
     ```
   - To access the data directly, you can start a temporary container and mount the volume to inspect its contents:
     ```bash
     docker run --rm -v es_data:/data busybox ls /data
     ```
   - This command mounts the `es_data` volume to `/data` inside a temporary `busybox` container and lists the contents of the directory.

### Summary

- **No Need to Create Folders Manually**: Docker automatically creates and manages the `es_data` volume. You don’t need to manually create any folders in your project directory.
- **Permissions Managed by Docker**: Docker takes care of the permissions for volumes. Typically, no additional permission configuration is required unless you need to manually interact with the volume's data outside of Docker.

You should be able to run your setup with `docker-compose up` without worrying about creating folders or managing permissions manually. Docker will handle everything for you.
